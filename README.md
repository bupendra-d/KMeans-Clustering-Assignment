Wholesale Customer Segmentation using K-Means

📌 Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment wholesale customers based on their annual spending patterns. The objective is to identify groups of customers with similar purchasing behavior using **unsupervised learning**.

📊 Dataset
Wholesale Customers Dataset

Features Used:
- Fresh  
- Milk  
- Grocery  
- Frozen  
- Detergents_Paper  
- Delicassen  

All features are numerical and suitable for clustering.

🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  


🔍 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Selected numerical spending attributes  
3. Applied **StandardScaler** for normalization  
4. Used the **Elbow Method** to determine optimal clusters  
5. Applied **K-Means (K = 5)**  
6. Assigned cluster labels and visualized results  


📈 Result & Conclusion
The model successfully grouped customers into **five distinct clusters**, each representing different purchasing behaviors. This segmentation can help businesses improve customer targeting and decision-making.
